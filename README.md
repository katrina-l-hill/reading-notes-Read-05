Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):
•	CSS is a language used to style source code in a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document and present it.
•	It’s a language all its own like, HTML and JavaScript and is used to style content for website pages.
•	CSS has its own architecture for coding just like HTML and JavaScript.
•	A great resource for information on CSS, selectors, links, and other how-to is MDN.
 
CSS Links:
•	You can link different style sheets together in CSS that contain information to be used by either sheet.
•	Links can be styled with various CSS properties such as colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, etc.
•	You can also design a website layout through the headers, footers, and navigation menu.
 
CSS Layout:
•	Everything in CSS is a box and needs to be structured, e.g., header, main, footer.
•	You should only have one header, main, and footer tags.
•	The main part of a CSS layout pertains to the main content of the web page.
